Abstract 

Due to the continuous change in the topology of ad hoc networks and the lack of a central directory for publishing web 
services, makes the process of finding web services a very difficult challenge, several approaches have been proposed, all 
these solutions are based on either a keyword or ID representing the service to be searched, or using a specific scenario of 
discovery, all this with trying to respect the constraints of ad-hoc networks such as energy, bandwidth ... etc. In this work 
we  proposed  a  model  for  measuring  the  cost  of  the  overall  energy  consumption  in  ad  hoc  networks  depending  on  the 
mechanisms proposed by the approaches and protocols for discovering web services.

1. Introduction  

Like any innovation, the emergence of services has resulted in a set of opportunities and new applications. 
Today,  Web  services  are  everywhere  in  numbers.  Whether  services  online  reservations  or  management  of 
bank accounts and even business applications, all these services share in common the fact of being accessible

as  Web  services.  Web  services  speaks  XML,  they  are  described  in  a  WSDL  (Web  Services  Description 
Language) [1] format specifying the methods that can be invoked, their signature and service’s access points 
(URL, Port, Etc.). These methods are accessible via SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) [2]. Web services 
are  centralized  (their  publications)  in  a  common  repository  UDDI  (Universal  Description  Discovery  and 
Integration) [3] in order to facilitate their research. 

Because of frequent changes in network topology in an ad hoc mobile environment, the absence of a fixed 
centralized directory, the limits of  wireless connection and energy constraints of mobile devices makes the 
achievement  of  discovery  protocols  web  services  designed  for  ad  hoc  networks  a  very  sought  challenge,  
several approaches and protocols have been developed in that regard, in this article we present our model to 
calculate,  verify  and  validate  protocols of web  services discovery  in  mobile ad hoc  networks  depending on  
energy cost to respect in these types of networks. 

2. Web service discovery protocols in ad hoc networks 

The key elements in web service discovery protocols are: service description, search mechanisms and the 
type of network. The discovery of services in ad hoc network is an important problem, in the works that exist; 
each one is based on the above elements. 

In KONARK [4], which is a protocol for discovering web services for ad hoc networks, which aims mobile 
e-commerce applications, each node in the network acts as a directory of services available in the network, the 
authors use a tree in each node to classify the available services in the network, the classification is generic in 
top-level (root) and becomes increasingly accurate down the tree. The authors proposed a mechanism for web 
services discovery and publication. In publication, each provider broadcasts its new services in the network, 
so that each node incorporates this service in its tree (Replication of information about services available in 
the network). In Discovery Phase, if a client looks for a service, he broadcasts a request based on a Name or 
Type of service, the relevant servers returns responses containing the desired services and the URL of their 
WSDL descriptions, the client records this information in his local tree of services. The major disadvantage of 
KONARK protocol is the significant waste of resources due to the recording of the same information in each 
node of the network, even if the information will not be used by the node. 

In the approach proposed by [5], the authors have segmented the network to reduce traffic areas because it 
is not obvious that each node acts as a registry to record all the services, even less a replication of the same 
information in all nodes of the network, So they assume that in each area there are a Master-Host who acts as 
a  UDDI  registry,  it  can  also  recognize  all  the  nodes  that  connects  in  this  area,  They  also  proposed  a 
mechanism  for  replication  and  synchronization of  UDDI registries information  to  ensure  the reliability  and 
consistency of the information available in the network (bandwidth consumption). The major inconvenient in 
[5] is the use of the principle of Master-Host as access point!  It means they assume it is fixed so it returns to a 
network  with  infrastructure,  otherwise  it  begs  the  next  question,  what  happens  when  the  Master  host  is 
disconnected from the area? 

In [6] the authors proposed a web services discovery and publication protocol that interacts with routing 
protocols to optimize the services research, they assumed two types of services (ordinary and special) each 
provider broadcast advertisements of special services it offers, and if a client wants to find an ordinary service 
it sends a request based on the distance (HOP) and the type of service looked for, this mechanism requires the 
client interaction for the selection of desired services and will be repeated with increasing HOP until the client  
satisfaction, the intermediate nodes uses a cache to store the common services found. The disadvantage in this 
approach  is  the  replication  of  information  about  special  services  in  all  nodes  of  the  network  and  a  high 
consumption  of  bandwidth  by  the  messages  of  the  research  and  the  additional  use  of  storage  resources  for 
intermediate storage of the services found even if they will not be used.

3. Evaluation of the energy cost 

We  noticed  that  each  of  the  approaches  discussed  violated  one  or  more  constraints  posed  in  ad  hoc 
networks  such  as  bandwidth  and  storage  resources  ...  etc.  This  will  result  in  a  significant  consumption  of 
energy.  We  also  noted  that  the  proposed  discovery  approaches  are  based  on  the  IDs  of  the  services,  their 
names and types with a client intervention for the selection of service that satisfied their needs. 

The following table shows a comparison between the approaches studied, depending on a set of elements 

which influence in direct or indirect manner on the energy consumed in the ad hoc networks.

“Uncertain 
Discovery” 

In Table 1, we collected several constraints Ci  that influence in a direct or indirect manner on the main 
constraints to be respected in the ad hoc networks, where Ci = {Bandwidth, Resources, discovery mechanism, 
Energy}, we used all this specific constraints to web services discovery approches in ad hoc networks as well 
as the results of works in [7] and [8], to propose a formula for measuring the energy cost which allow us to 
evaluate the relationship between ad hoc the energy constraint and web services discovery protocol. 

The  proposed  formula  (1)  for  measuring  the  cost  of  influence  on  the  energy  consumed  in  each  node 

depending on constraints Ci is given as follows

CostCi 

cost of influence on energy relative to each constraint Ci in each node 

To calculate CostC1 that represents the cost of influence on the electrical energy consumed in each node 
depending on the number, size and type of packets circulating in the network. We are oriented to the work 
proposed in [7] who presented several results  measuring energy consumption, they identified four states of 
energy consumption: 

(cid:120) Transmission: The transmission of packets. 
(cid:120) Reception: The reception of packets. 
(cid:120) Waiting: Waiting for a packet transfer. 
(cid:120) Sleeping: The state of lowest energy consumption when the node cannot receive or transmit. 
The energy cost associated with each packet to each node is represented by the total incremental cost m 
proportional of the packet size, and a fixed cost b associated with acquisition channel. The formula (2) below 
is used to calculate the energy cost for each packet in each node of the network.

This formula indicates the direct relationship between the size, number of packets and bandwidth at each 

node, the formula (3) is the formula that we have proposed to calculate CostC1

The  following  Fig  1  represents  the  graph  of  comparison  between  the  different  discovery  approaches 
studied  depending  on  the  cost  of  energy  calculated  from  the  proposed  formula,  where  the  Node  axis 
represents  the  number  of  nodes  in  the  network  and  the  Energy-Cost  axis  represents  the  cost  of  energy 
calculated from the proposed formula. 

Fig. 1. Comparison between discovery approaches depending on the energy cost 

As shown in Fig 1 after evaluation of studied approaches by the formula proposed, the approach proposed 
in [5] is less greedy in terms of the overall energy consumption compared to SEDIRAN [6] and KONARK [4] 
protocols.

4. Conclusion 

In this paper we have presented our proposed formula to calculate the cost of the energy consumed in an ad 
hoc environment depending on the approaches or protocols of Web services discovery. This formula is based 
on  Ci  parameters  that  we  have  taken  in  our  comparative  studies  between  different  existing  discovery 
approaches. This formula will allow us to evaluate any web services discovery protocol depending on the total 
of energy consumed.
