Abstract 

Distributed  generation  (DG)  systems  are  considered  an  integral  part  in  future  distribution  power  system.  The  reactive 
power  injections  from  DG  units,  are  seen  as  a  cost-effective  solution  for  distribution  system  voltage  support,  energy 
saving, and reliability improvement. This paper proposes a coordinating control method of reactive power optimization in 
distribution power system with distributed wind energy. The reactive capability limits of doubly fed induction generator 
(DFIG) are included in the optimization model. The problem of reactive power output/absorb of adjustable compensating 
capacitor and wind turbine (WT) is formulated as constrained conditions; differential evolution algorithm (DE) integrating 
depth-first search is developed to effectively obtain optimal solutions. The proposed algorithm is applied to a practical test 
system and results are compared and presented.

1. Introduction 

Distributed generation is the direction of future power industry. Wind energy is the most widely used clean 
renewable energy. Distributed wind turbines(WT) are connected to the grid as distributed power sources and 
have brought significant impact on the system power flow distribution, voltage level and transmission loss.

Adequate  voltage  stability  margin  needs  to  be  obtained  through  the  appropriate  scheduling  of  the  reactive 
power resources [1].

Asynchronous wind turbines have simple structure and easy interconnection, but need to absorb reactive 
power  from  system  in  running  state,  there  is  no  excitation  device  and  capability  of  voltage  regulation[2].
Currently, the most common technology used is the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG), which is able to 
provide reactive power support. A large variety of control strategies can be used in the operation of DFIG 

The author in [3] has proposed a wind turbine control strategy in which the converters of grid side and rotor 
side are reserves of each other. In [4], a method to calculate the reactive power limit of system with DFIG 
considering  grid-side  converter  reactive  power  limit  is  proposed,  and  the  DFIG  wind  farm  are  used  for 
reactive  power  compensation.  [5]  focused  on  including  the  reactive  power  capability  of  the  DFIG  turbines 
directly in the optimization formulation, and proposed a multiobjective reactive power planning strategy for 
WF and transmission system devices. 

In  this  paper,  we  focus  on  the  reactive  power  optimization  of  distributed  system  with  distributed  wind 
power, asynchronous wind turbines, adjustable compensating capacitor and DFIG technology is considered, 
and the reactive power capability of converter also taking into consideration.

2. Mathematic model of wind turbine generator 

2.1 Mathematic model of Variable Speed Constant Frequency Wind Turbine Generator 

The  DFIG  has  two  set  of  windings  including  rotor  winding  and  stator  winding.  The  stator  winding  is 
connected directly to the grid through grid-side converter, GSC. The DC side voltage is controlled by GSC, 
and the power factor is adjusted according to the demand of grid.  

The value is set to positive when rotor and stator generating active power and inductive reactive power into 

grid. Then the power injected to the system by DFIG can be written as: 

There are two main operating mode for DFIG: Constant power factor and constant voltage. Where

2.2 Reactive power limit of GSC 

The  essence  of  GSC  is  a  voltage  type  PWM  rectifier,  the  AC  side  has  the  unique  characteristics  of  a 
controlled current source, it can run in four quadrant. The GSC usually run in unit power factor condition, if

3.1 Mathematical model 

The  objective  of  reactive  power  optimization  model  is  to  reduce  the  loss  of  system,  reactive  power

Where  h  is  equality  constraint,  namely  power  flow  equation,  g is  inequality  constraints,  including  the 
branch power restriction, the node voltage constraints and upper and lower limits of control variables; u and
x  represent control variables and state variables respectively. 

3.2 Power flow model of distribution power system based on depth search 

The benefit of the power flow calculation methods based on depth search is that could ignore the specific 
network  in  radial  topology,  only  need  to  know  the  base  information  of  the  node  structure  and  the  branch 
structure. In this paper, choose the voltage deviation as the termination condition of power flow calculation: 

(cid:100)                                                               (10)

procedure is given in Fig.1. The threshold of reactive power loss employ the average reactive power loss of 
network  without  WT,  and  considering  the  termination  condition  can  not  be  satisfied,  set  the  maximum

4.1 Access form of distribution WT 

In this paper, chose a distribution power system as test case, bus voltage is 1.05(p.u.), reference power is  
100 MVA, reference voltage is 10 KV. The chosen network is radial topology including three lines contain 

424 nodes, which the line 1 has 224 nodes, the line 2 has 119 nodes and the line 3 has 81 nodes. 

There  are  6  access  points  which  all  in  frontier  nodes,  shown  in  Table 1.  Because  the WT  output  power 
fluctuate, given the wind speed random in the case, according to the wind power characteristic curve to ensure
