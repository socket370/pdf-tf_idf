Distributed  generation  (DG)  systems  are  considered  an  integral  part  in  future  distribution  power  system.  The  reactivepower  injections  from  DG  units,  are  seen  as  a  cost-effective  solution  for  distribution  system  voltage  support,  energysaving, and reliability improvement. This paper proposes a coordinating control method of reactive power optimization indistribution power system with distributed wind energy. The reactive capability limits of doubly fed induction generator(DFIG) are included in the optimization model. The problem of reactive power output/absorb of adjustable compensatingcapacitor and wind turbine (WT) is formulated as constrained conditions; differential evolution algorithm (DE) integratingdepth-first search is developed to effectively obtain optimal solutions. The proposed algorithm is applied to a practical testsystem and results are compared and presented.© 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B. V.
