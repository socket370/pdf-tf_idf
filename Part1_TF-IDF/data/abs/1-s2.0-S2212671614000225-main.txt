Due to the continuous change in the topology of ad hoc networks and the lack of a central directory for publishing webservices, makes the process of finding web services a very difficult challenge, several approaches have been proposed, allthese solutions are based on either a keyword or ID representing the service to be searched, or using a specific scenario ofdiscovery, all this with trying to respect the constraints of ad-hoc networks such as energy, bandwidth ... etc. In this workwe  proposed  a  model  for  measuring  the  cost  of  the  overall  energy  consumption  in  ad  hoc  networks  depending  on  themechanisms proposed by the approaches and protocols for discovering web services.© 2014 The Authors.
